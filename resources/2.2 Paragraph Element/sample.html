<p>You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers? Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.</p>

<p>So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! Mistakes have been made. Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night.</p>

<p>If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country. Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? Mouth-breather. Mouth-breather. Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon?</p>

<p>Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more.</p>
